# Chest X-Ray Scan Analysis

This project is designed with a clear motive — to explore how **image processing and AI** can be applied in the medical field for early and accurate detection of lung diseases.  
By analyzing chest X-ray images, the system assists in identifying potential abnormalities such as pneumonia or other respiratory conditions.

---

## Objective
To demonstrate how deep learning and computer vision can support radiologists by automating the process of X-ray scan interpretation — making diagnosis faster, more reliable, and scalable.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python** – Core development  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep learning model training  
- **OpenCV** – Image preprocessing and enhancement  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Visualization of model predictions  

---

## Features
- Upload and analyze chest X-ray scans  
- Detect normal vs. abnormal conditions  
- Display prediction probabilities and visual heatmaps  
- Provide interpretable and reproducible results  

---

## Output Example
- **Prediction:** Normal / Pneumonia / Other anomaly  
- **Confidence Score:** 0.92  
- **Visualization:** Region heatmap overlay on X-ray image  

---

## Vision
To bridge healthcare and technology by using **AI-driven medical imaging** for faster and more affordable diagnosis, especially in remote or resource-limited areas.
